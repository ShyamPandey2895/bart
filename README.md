# Bart

Bart is a PHP project. It originally began its life as a collection of Build and Release Tools used internally at Box. Over time, it's grown into a collection of critical pieces of our PHP frameworks.

We use it at Box as the base of almost all of our open source projects and several of our internal projects.

Please read through the [Bart Wiki](https://github.com/box/bart/wiki) for full details of the features and configurations.
